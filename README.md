# WinBatchX
##### WinBatchX is a successful operating system in batch script made for any windows computer (At lest NT 6.1+) that presents a working Windows-like computer inside the command line. By using some GUI tools for mouse input and full-image displayers, an 'batch' operating system was made over the next possible Windows Release. Over 100 builds have been released since WinBatchX's start in January 2020.

- The latest release is WinBatchX 18- the Windows 11 Update.

- The previewing release is WinBatchX 18.1. WinBatchX 18 will be upgraded automatically to 18.1 when it releases when it checks for updates. (Switch it off in settings)

- The developing release is now WinBatchX 19. This release is minor and will be released by December 2022.

##### As we have released WinBatchX 18, WinBatchX 16 releases and below will be supported until November 31, 2022. WinBatchX 17 is also ending support by December 31, 2022.
