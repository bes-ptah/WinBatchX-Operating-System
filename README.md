# winbatchOS

winbatchOS is a successful operating system in batch script inside any supported Windows Release. Over 100 builds have been released since WinBatchX's start in January 2020. The latest release is 18.0 - The Windows 11 Update. The latest stable build is currently 1800 (r18.0!), and our previewing release is 18.1 (1850).
WinBatchX was our predecessor to WinBatchOS, and laid down many of the rules, policies, infrastructure, and design principles that lead today's builds.
