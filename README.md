#### WinBatchX Alpha branch
###### Current WinBatchX Beta builds don't have features that I have been expermenting around (Start Menu Design Changes, Do not Disturb Notifications, etc.), which may be included in WinBatchX 18.0. For now, builds after the 17.0 update will appear as 'alpha' builds. This channel is where I experment with many new features, including a non-compatible new kernel and faster expermential display load speeds. Most of these builds come from very early versions of WinBatchX (1730-80 builds) and are put in this channel to allow 17.1 and 18.0 development.

###### This channel is completely unstable and acts as preview what I may do next for WinBatchX. Not all of these ideas will reach release.

###### (!) All builds are not supported but have a lot of features.
