###### **For older builds (1532-1558) will be marked with error code 0x02- unsupported release.**

###### **WinBatchX 15.4 (April 2021 Update) did not come with wget.exe. No user will be notified of WinBatchX 16 because it didn't come with it. (We were planing that before Build 1540)**

# How to install

#### **NOTE: WinBatchX has removed support for Windows 10 Version 1903. It will continue to work on that version, but know no support is coming for that version of Windows 10.**

###### WinBatchX is designed to be portable wherever you go. You just need the core files (which is a lot of lightweight applications) and WinBatchX itself.
###### 1. Click on the latest release on the right. For smaller screens, scroll the bottom of the page, then click on the latest release.
###### 2. Download the latest version or build from the releases page.
###### 3. Unzip the file to a destination. This is a .zip file, meaning Windows Explorer can read it. You can use 3rd-Party tools to unzip it.
###### 4. Click "WinBatchX". It will start up, setting a number of variables while retriving updates. All of the batch files, batch plugins and the update are scanned by the command line from Windows Security. 
###### 5. The password is always "bes". (The owner of WinBatchX's first name)

###### **Follow these directions if you are on build 1564 or higher**
###### 5. The Username is "Guest" and the Password is "bes". Remember to change this as soon as possible by going to SETTINGS > ACCOUNTS > Change Password. You can change the username too.

###### **Build 1560+ Changing Usernames and Passwords are only available Builds 1560 and up.**

###### **Build 1538+: Changing Usernames and Passwords manually can be done by going into SYSTEM > CONFIG.BAT in Windows Explorer.**

###### 6. You reached the WinBatchX desktop!

###### NOTE Running WinBatchX as an adminstrator will fail since the file will change directory to the System32 Windows Folder.
###### NOTE Setup for WinBatchX will come in later builds of 16.1.
