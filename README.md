> A high number of 18.0 builds were excluded from official release due to lots of bugs and errors. They were added all together in builds 1660-1665. Normal development has now started in builds 1770+.

#### As always, only the last 4 builds from the latest beta build are supported for bugs or errored features to be fixed. All builds from 1558-16.1-beta2 and up are always supported for security faults and fixes.

### Please note: Windows Version 19H1 is not supported now on WinBatchX. Windows 10 Version 1909 or higher are supported.

#### ( ! ) This is open-source so even your copy (or your custom build) of WinBatchX is allowed to pull releases from this build.
