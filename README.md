# WinBatchX
#### WinBatchX is a successful operating system in batch script made for any windows release (NT 6.1+) that shows a working GUI, desktop and buttons inside the command line. Over 95 builds have tested this for about a year now. The latest release is 16.0 - The Windows ModernPC (10X) Update. It's update (16.1) is recieved as an 'addon'. The previewing release is the 17.0 release.

#### ( ! ) Tested with the latest Insider build; Windows 11 Insider Release Build 25115
#### ( ! ) We don't support 32-bit operating systems because some of our GUI programs are 64-bit only.

###### Our next release, WinBatchX 17.0, will be released between late June 2022.

###### WinBatchX 17.0's builds may be stable between April and May 2022.

###### To understand a release number:

###### (build)-(version release)-(beta, dev)(release beta/dev number version)
###### 1738-16.91-beta0

#### Any build or release NOT stated here is no longer supported for any bug, error or issue. We have updated update.bat to show you that infomation (If you are using b1558+).
#### Any build above b1558 is always supported for any security issues that arrise, but that may change later on.


#### ( ! ) This is open-source so even your copy (or your custom build) of WinBatchX is allowed to pull releases from this build.
#### ( ! ) If you are using Windows 10 1909 or lower, we don't support those versions offically anymore. These are very old releases and you should most likely update to the most recent WINDOWS version (Windows 10 21H2, or Windows 11 October 2021).
