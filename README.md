**16.0 Release**

June 8 2021

*Are we releasing releases too fast? no, because we missed a few bugs opon release to the world.*

We are again late releasing 16.0 due to a few missed bugs. The 16.0 release of WinBatchX is released! This release solves a lot of problems and includes new features. [Take a look for "1600-16.0" on the github releases page for more details.](https://github.com/bes-ptah/WinBatchX/releases/tag/1600-16.0) . The demo app exists still for developers who want to code this version.

This was moved from the "16.0 Notes" section.

**Read Carefully. The dates have changed.**

Release | Date | Info

17.0 | December 2021 | NI 12

There will be 3 releases each year; one in January, June and November. There are patches after the initial release.

16.0 is supported for 3 months. At the end of support stage for 16.0, 16.1 will be released with 3 months of support, and so on.




**Last build for WinBatchX Builds was 1578**

June 8 2021

Build 1578 was the last build in the "15" major build number. There were 39 builds in total, 36 stable and 3 unstable builds (not including types of builds).



**15.5 Release**

June 3 2021

***SKIP THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE VERY LOW DISK SPACE***

WinBatchX is releasing the 15.5 "June 2021" Update. From now on, the numbers represented on the minor release number are not focused on a month. 15.5 has new features, including maintaining applications to work no matter what error happens. The majority of the disk space used are the photos and how big the bmp files are in the "insertbmp" folder. Windowed Mode in WinBatchX is slated for another release. The demo app (no idea why it's in this release) is there for any developer to work on. 16.0 will continue to be released June 7 2021.

**EDIT 06/08/2021** | Windowed Mode is expected in 17.0. 

Support is for 5 months, until November 2021.

16.0 is supported for 3 months. At the end of support stage for 16.0, 16.1 will be released with 3 months of support.




**15.2 End of support**

June 1 2021

Today, WinBatchX has ended support of the 15.2 Febuary Update. This release was overhauled to extended support due to build 1520, which was unstable. That caused 15.3 to never release. 15.4 also had a similar problem; where build 1530 crashed on start. That started a new, functional interface to come into 15.5. 15.5 will release June 3 2021, before 16.0. 15.5 is expected to be supported throughout June and July before ending in August.

After build 1600, we will release both odd and even numbered builds.


**16.0 Notes**

May 7 2021

As of here, WinBatchX is releasing the first beta version of 16.0: Build 1540. By May 15, we'll be able to add all the applications into the desktop. The NI (UI) is expected to be finished by June 1st. Then some release candidate(s) will be released to the public if needed. The initial release is expected for June 7th 2021, with support for 3 months. Report any bugs on the GitHub page.

*INFOMATION HERE IS NOW IN THE 16.0 RELEASE*






**Update 6/3/2021**More Release Notes

Version | Released | EOR (End of Release Support)
--|--|--
16.0 | June 7 2021 | eor at September 21 2021
16.1 | September 3 2021 | eor at december 3 2021
16.2 | November 28 2021 | final eor at Febuary 15 2021





**Relaunching applications into the NI 7 library**

May 4 2021

Today we are releasing Build 1538. It includes EDGE.EXE, which is completely brand new with directions on how to use it. As this build stabilizes in Build 1540, we will add more applications that work with the NI 7 library.


**NI 6 will stay away from #7**

April 30 2021

The title might seem confusing, right? 
The NI 6 library variables were revolutionary and solved most of the work for WinBatchX. Well, the applications from that set isn't going to go into the NI 7.1 Desktop. It would be hard to move the variables and the amount of bugs stacking behind. There were 3 new applications added into the desktop for Build 1538.
**This build has the (not imported) created new apps and the start menu.**



**WinBatchX Build 1600 - 16.0**

April 30 2021

You're thinking, "too Early?" Well, it's we're also never late with our releases.
This update will be released to the general public on June 11 2021. It will definitely have more features than The previous update, 6 months ago. This will have at least 20 or more usable apps, if everything goes as planned. There are already 36 files to make WinBatchX work properly. There will be a configuration system, the new-based .htmlbatch coming soon. It will ship with NI 9's library.
(If everything goes as planned)



**Announcing WinBatchX Final Build 1526: 15.4**

April 29 2021

Today, the team behind WinBatchX's development is now releasing the final build of 1526. This includes lots of new features, including icons, a new file manager and "EDGE.EXE" update. The action center was also added. 
Some notes:
This build clearly has some bugs. It was considered over Build 1528, which had more bugs.
This is the second-last build part of the "NI 6" Group. Build 1528 is the last one, while Build 1530 is unstable. (NI 10 will be better)
The version number has been updated. The April Update is now 15.4. The number 4 equals April, the fourth month of the release.
WINBATCHX is still not ready for production use. This is still in the beta stages, as how far we made with the applications. 
**Who has build 1512 Febuary Update: Tomorrow is the last day of support on that build. Move to a better build of WinBatchX.**



**April Update will be Build 1526**

April 27 2021

Build 1530 was supposed to be a ton of updates, meaning it will likely be to crash. The April Update has been backwinded to Build 1526, the last stable update. Check it out in the Beta Builds. We're also not sure if WGET.EXE, the download manager wget.exe is not causing this problem. is causing this problem. We might use curl as the download manager.
**NOTICE: Build 1530 is not supported, even if it is released to the beta branch. (It's for developers)**
**Build 1530 is now in the old releases branch.**



**"Wget" will be used as default update manager for Build 1530**

April 14 2021

It is now final that wget is the default update manager for WinBatchX. Wget is a Linux program used to download and save files from the internet. There was an executable from Linux complied to windows. It will be used to update WinBatchX and will be added in June 2021's update. (Build 1530 actually has it) 
 

**Error fixed**

April 8 2021

We have noticed in the version support section, February 2021's update ended March 30, 2020. We extended the supported date to April 30th because we do not have a stable build ready yet. 

**The name has changed!**

March 30 2021

Today, the BatchWin team had one final decision to change the name to WinBatchX. "BatchWin" wasn't a great name for our "batch script" machine, and we were working on adding a new interface. Note also Build 1520 is Unstable, meaning you should not use it for production reasons. As Build 1522 gets under the work of the team, we are working on another upgrade of the Interface. The version is bumped up 1520 and is the same number as the build version. 

**BatchWin 15.0 March 2021 Update Notice**

March 12 2021

The BatchWin Team has now chosen to halt the March 2021 Update and April 2021 Update. The predicted next release is set to May. By the time of release, there will be a new "System" folder having all the contents of the operating system. The license will change over to UNLICENSE. Also, expect to have in Build 1514 to have curl, a new download manager complied.

**BatchWin 15.0 February 2021 Update RELEASE**

February 26 2021

Today the BatchWin team has released the BatchWin 15.0 February 2021 Update. Build 1512, also known as BatchWin15.0-Feb2021. There was a major overhaul on the User Experience and Interface. There will be more patches; including not reaching the new "desk" coming soon in the next update.

**BatchWin 15.0 January 2021 Update RELEASE**

January 29 2021

BatchWin team has released the BatchWin 15.0 January 2021 Update. This is the first update released to the public. Older releases "5.03 - 7.1" Beta and "8.03 - 12.0" Alpha are in the old.releases page. BatchWin 15.0 January 2021 update does not have extended main support status. There are not much features to this update, but will expand soon.

-Unknown on 32-bit systems. Works on Intel 64, x64, and AMD64 Processors. ARM64 not tested.
 




# How to install

**NOTE: WinBatchX has removed support for Windows 10 Version 1903. It will continue to work on that version, but know no support is coming for that version of Windows 10.**

WinBatchX is designed to be portable wherever you go. You just need the core files (which is a lot of lightweight applications) and WinBatchX itself.
1. Click on the latest release on the right. For smaller screens, scroll the bottom of the page, then click on the latest release.
2. Download the latest version or build from the releases page.
3. Unzip the file to a destination. This is a .zip file, meaning Windows Explorer can read it. You can use 3rd-Party tools to unzip it.
4. Click "WinBatchX". It will start up, setting a number of variables while retriving updates. All of the batch files, batch plugins and the update are scanned by the command line from Windows Security. 
5. The password is always "bes". (The owner of WinBatchX's first name)

**Follow these directions if you are on build 1564 or higher**
5. The Username is "Guest" and the Password is "bes". Remember to change this as soon as possible by going to SETTINGS > ACCOUNTS > Change Password. You can change the username too.

**Build 1560+ Changing Usernames and Passwords are only available Builds 1560 and up.**

**Build 1538+: Changing Usernames and Passwords manually can be done by going into SYSTEM > CONFIG.BAT in Windows Explorer.**

6. You reached the WinBatchX desktop!

NOTE Running WinBatchX as an adminstrator will fail since the file will change directory to the System32 Windows Folder.
NOTE Setup for WinBatchX will come in later builds of 16.1.
