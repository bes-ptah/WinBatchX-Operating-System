#### WinBatchX Alpha branch
###### WinBatchX is a batch script operating system with over 80 working builds. These builds come through this branch first for early developers and testers.

##### The next release planned is WinBatchX 18.0 and is planned for release out of the beta channel by November 15, 2022 . This next release has around 20 planned builds for release.



> A high number of 18.0 builds were excluded from official release due to lots of bugs and errors. They were added all together in builds 1660-1665. Normal development has now started in builds 1770+.
