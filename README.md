# WinBatchX Batch Script OS
#### WinBatchX is a successful operating system in batch script made for any windows release (NT 6.1+) that shows a working GUI, desktop and buttons inside the command line. Many builds have tested this, over and over for about a year now (Started October 2019, public releases in January 2020). The latest release is 16.0 - The Windows ModernPC (10X) Update.

#### ( ! ) Tested with the latest Insider build; Windows 11 Insider Release Build 22533
#### ( ! ) We don't support 32-bit operating systems (and possibly ARM64 [not amd64] too!) because some of our GUI programs are 64-bit only. We may make a 32-bit copy of WinBatchX later on.

#### Any build or release NOT stated here is no longer supported for any bug, error or issue. We have updated update.bat to show you that infomation (If you are using b1530+).
#### Any build above b1530 is always supported for any security issues that arrise, but that might change later on.
#### ( ! ) This is open-source so even your copy (or your custom build) of WinBatchX is allowed to pull releases from this build.
#### ( ! ) If you are using Windows 10 1903 or lower, we don't support those versions offically anymore. These are very old releases and you should most likely update to the most recent version (Windows 10 21H2+ Windows 11 Initial+).
