rem 1.  Definitions
rem The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution"
rem have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law. A "contribution" is
rem the original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A
rem "contributor" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
rem license. "Licensed patents" are a contributor's patent claims that read
rem directly on its contribution.
