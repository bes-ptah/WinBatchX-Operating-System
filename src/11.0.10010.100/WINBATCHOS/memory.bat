rem READ ALL WARNINGS BELOW

rem (!) This version of memory.bat DOES NOT WORK YET. Come back in a newer version
rem     of WinBatchX.


rem (!) The terminology is quite confusing right now, so see a new build for
rem     better terminology(words) on WinBatchX Memory.
rem.
rem     Or check the wiki in github!



rem We load WinBatchX now im supposedly 'memory', so we write 64 lines for it.
rem If we run out of memory, we might add a page file (actually working) for it.

rem SO this is WinBatchX Memory:

rem We use WBX Memory to load apps/services that need to be put in memory.
rem Everything is NOW put in memory! You can actually try to still bypass it.

rem Memory: 64 bytes of memory.
rem This build has 64 'sets' of memory. Think of 'sets' as a file on a computer.
rem There are 'lines' in each 'set'. An example is the stuff in a file.
rem There are a maxinium set of lines (which is 2048).





rem Organized as:
rem System Reserved > Using > Standby (Overwriten) > Free
