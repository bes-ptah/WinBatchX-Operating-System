# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

While all releases are supported on security releases (ONLY 1530+ up are actually supported because they download updates from this repository) you should go for a more updated release if you're behind the 16.0 release.



## Reporting a Vulnerability

Make a issue in the issues section. Not accepting vulnerabilies from mail nor discussions, but you can help if you want to by making a pull request (with the update folder)
